Your wait staff was so pleasant and helpfull. Your menu is classic French executed authentically. Do not change a thing!! The kitchen, the staff, the menu, the wine list, the bakery (I couldn’t eat another bite so I took a raspberry tart to go) are all the finest. I will recommend to everyone The French Gourmet. Don’t change a thing! You are spot on!",
